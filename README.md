# RecommendationSystem

Recommendation system. Performed in python. It was originally developed in Google colab.

It is necessary to charge the data (ratings_Electronics.csv).

Probably, the path (path_ratingselectronics) must be changed in order to correctly charge the data.
 
You can download the two files (the ipynb and the csv files) and upload them in your personal google drive and run. It is easy.

The goal of the project is as follows. You are a Data Science Manager at Amazon, and have been given the task of building a recommendation system to recommend products to customers based on their previous ratings for other products. You have a collection of labeled data of Amazon reviews of products. The goal is to extract meaningful insights from the data and build a recommendation system that helps in recommending products to online consumers.
